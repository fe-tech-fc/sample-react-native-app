# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have Android Studio working and emulator set-up. If not, please complete this.

## Step 1: Install node modules

```bash
# Install node modules using Yarn
yarn
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
